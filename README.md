shadowsocks-libuv
=================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dndx/shadowsocks-libuv.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dndx/shadowsocks-libuv)

shadowsocks is a lightweight tunnel proxy which can help you get through firewalls. 

protol made by [clowwindy](https://raw.github.com/clowwindy/), libuv port by [dndx](https://github.com/dndx)

This is only a **server**, it should works with any shadowsocks client. 

Current version: 0.1

This is an [Open Source](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) project and released under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Features
* Super fast and low resource consume (thanks to [libuv](https://github.com/joyent/libuv)), it can run very smoothly on almost any VPS. 
* Fully compatible to other port of shadowsocks. 

## Attention
This is an initial release and may not considered very stable, please open an issue if you encounter any bugs. Be sure to attach the error message so I can identify it. 

## How to Build
	$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dndx/shadowsocks-libuv.git
	$ cd shadowsocks-libuv/
	$ vim config.h
	$ make

Note that you need to rebuild it every time you modify config.h, just run `make` again and it will do rest of the work. 

Tested and confirmed to work on:

* Max OS X 10.8.2 x64 using clang 4.1
* CentOS 5.8 x86 using gcc 4.1.2
* CentOS 6.3 x64 using gcc 4.4.6

## How to Use
After you build shadowsocks successfully, you can rename the file `server` and move it to anywhere you want. 

Also there are command line options that can be used to override settings in config.h:

	$ ./server -?
	./server: invalid option -- ?
	Shadowsocks Version:0.1 libuv(0.9) Written by Dndx(idndx.com)
	Usage: ./server [-l listen] [-p port] [-k keyfile] [-f pidfile]

	Options:
      -l : Override the listening IP
	  -p : Override the listening port
	  -k : Override the listening password
	  -f : Override the pidfile path
If you want to run server in background, you can:

	$ nohup /path/to/server &

Note this will redirect all log generated by program to `nohup.out`. If you do not like any log to be saved, you can run:

	$ nohup /path/to/server > /dev/null 2>&1 &

This will throw all the message to a black hole. 

I suggest the first way. If your program does not run as expected, log file will be very important for me to identify the bug. 

## Known Issues
### Build Failed
	src/unix/linux/syscalls.h:74: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before ‘__u64’
1. First, make sure you have the latest kernel-headers by running `yum install kernel-headers`
2. Try make again, if it still complains, see next
3. `cd` to shadowsocks-libuv and `$ vim libuv/config-unix.mk`
4. At about line 22, you will see `CSTDFLAG=--std=c89 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter`
5. Change it to `CSTDFLAG=--std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter`
6. Save the file and run `make` again

## Performance
I did not fully benchmark it yet, but according to my use on [TinyVZ](http://tinyvz.com/) (OpenVZ 128M RAM and CentOS 5.8 x86). When streaming YouTube 1080p vedio at about 20Mbit/s bandwidth, it use at most 3% of RAM (RSS about 7500) and almost no CPU time. During webpage browse it use less than 0.7% RAM (RSS about 1164). Which can be considered effective.
